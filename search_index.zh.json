= a21 依次类推)\n\n邻接矩阵的大小=顶点数*顶点数\n很容易了解,一个图的顶点数决定了其对应邻接矩阵的大小,例如上图是个6个顶点的图,则对应的矩阵需要6*6的大小方可表达其结构\n\n数据压缩的属性\n\n由于事实上每一组顶点关系只需要一位来来表达,处理一个有4个顶点的图仅仅需要 44/8个=2个字节,这是很节省空间的,如果是一个无向图的话,所需要的空间则可以再减少一半的空间 44/16个=1个字节,通过这个方法已经接近信息论中表达一个n个顶点所需要字节数的下界.\n但是也存在一些问题,例如其可能需要存储那些本来不存在的边\n\n\n邻接链表\n\n概述\n邻接链表也是一种表达图的方式\n假设有无向图如下所示\n \n\n \n则相对应的表示为三个list{b,c},{a,c},{a,b}\n但是换出去空间的节省后,查询时间也会相应的边长\n例如:查询a与b是否有关系需要首先定位到a的链表{b,c},再对这个链表进行遍历,如果没有b,也就说明对其进行了完整的遍历,浪费了较多的时间,当然可以采用快速搜索的方式进行优化\n\n事实上邻接列表还有一点是其应用在大型稀疏矩阵中,因为邻接矩阵不需要浪费空间来表达那些不存在的边缘\n\n\n参考:\n\nAdjacency_matrix\nAdjacency_list\n\n","description":"","id":"https://blog.littleji.com/blog/20160512adjacencylistandadjacencymatrix/","path":"/blog/20160512adjacencylistandadjacencymatrix/","title":"邻接矩阵,邻接列表一些基本概念和应用(Adjacency

）问题。我们在这里给出了一种解决的办法，这种方法将网络时间戳通过hash转换，加入到一种基于hash的、持续伸展的“工作证明链”（以下简称工作链）中。攻击者除非能够将之前所做的工作再做一遍，否则无法更改这个工作证明链中已有的工作证明记录。也就是说，最长的工作链一方面证明了其见证了最多的交易记录，另一方面也说明了其所掌握的CPU计算能力（译注：HASH的计算能力）。只要大多数的CPU计算能力掌握在各个交易的个体手中，那么攻击者无法对该交易网络进行攻击。当然，这个交易系统也需要最基本的结构，个个节点也会最大范围的通知自己所记录的交易行为。由于最长的工作链存有所有的交易记录，所以每个节点可以在任意的时间脱离或者回到这个交易系统，而不会丢失其未曾见证的交易记录。\n\n0x01说明\n目前，互联网上的电子商务几乎完全依赖作为可信第三方的金融机构来处理电子支付。在大多数情况下，该交易模式可以应对，但它仍然受到基于信任模型的固有弱点的影响。比如，不可避免的调解纠纷，而调解成本又增加了交易成本，限制了最小的实际交易规模，并且切断了小型临时交易的可能性。尤其是，当需要运作而又无法正常的运作一笔“不可逆的交易”时，交易成本会大大的增加。由于该系统的提供信息有可能存在掺了假的或者过时的信息，所以交易的双方都需要花更多的成本在获取双方的信任上，进一步增加了交易的成本。这种交易机制在没有任何可信任的第三方见证的情况下，交易无法进行下去。\n事实上，目前所需要的是一种基于密码证明而不是信任的电子支付系统，这个系统允许任何两个愿意相互交易的双方，在不需要可信任的第三方的情况下进行交易。一方面，由于在实施欺骗需要付出巨大的计算代价，从而保护了卖家免受欺诈；另一方面，使容易被采用的常规托管机制，来保护买家。在本文中，我们提出了一个解决重复支付问题的解决方案，这个方案使用分布式时间戳服务器来顺序生成基于交易时间的工作证明。并且只要该系统中的所有坏人节点的计算能力不超过系统内的其他节点，那么就能保证这个系统是安全的。（译注：51%攻击）\n\n0x02交易\n这里定义一种电子货币保存一系列的数字签名。在交易的过程中，交易中的付款方首先将之前的交易与付款方的公钥一同进行hash，最终添加到付款方所持有的电子货币中，并传给收款方，收款方使用付款方的公钥对该电子货币进行验证是否为收款方的身份。\n问题在于，收款方无法确认付款方是否多花了钱。一般的解决方法是引入一个可信的第三方，或者说造币厂，对每一笔交易进行审查。具体过程是，每一笔交易发生时，付款方将所持有的货币传回给造币厂，造币厂则将这个货币摧毁，产生一个新的货币给收款方。这样以来，整个交易的过程安全性完全依赖于造币厂。\n而我们需要一种让收款者知道付款方没有进行二次交易。为了这个目的，我们可以在交易的过程中认为，只有最早的那笔交易是算数的，这样避免了二次交易情况的发生。收款方通过遍历所有的交易来验证付款方发出交易请求而收款方没有收到这一情况。要想脱离造币厂的模型，交易必须被广而告之，并且需要一个系统来帮助所有的参与者决策交易的到达顺序，收款方在判断一个交易的到达时间时需要这个系统内的其他节点进行投票决定，少数服从多数。\n\n0x03时间戳服务器\n时间戳服务器是一切的开始，时间戳服务器工作原理是对一个block进行hash，并对其结果进行广播。建立时间戳服务器的意义主要是为了证明某一个数据在一个时间点一定存在。在组成一个链的时候，每一个时间戳的生成都会考虑到之前时间戳的信息。\n\n参考\n比特币白皮书\n","description":"","id":"https://blog.littleji.com/blog/20180117bitcoin/","path":"/blog/20180117bitcoin/","title":"比特币白皮书"},"https://blog.littleji.com/blog/20180907gettingstartedwithi3windowmanager/":{"body":"注：本文首发于linux中国\n本篇文章会介绍如何在Fedora系统中，安装、配置、使用i3桌面管理器。\n\n在我的文章i3 桌面让Linux更好的5个理由，我分享了选择 i3 桌面管理器 作为一种Linux桌面替代方案的最主要五个理由。\n在本篇文章中，我将向大家展示，如何在 Fedora 28 上安装与配置 i3。\n\n1. 安装\n首先进入 Fedora 系统中，打开一个终端。使用 dnf 来安装需要的软件包，如下：\n\n注意：在这个命令中，我排除了 rxvt-unicode 这个包，因为我更喜欢 terminator 作为我的终端模拟器。\n据用户目前的系统状态，在命令执行过程中可能会安装很多依赖。等待所有的依赖安装完成，之后重启你的电脑。\n\n2. 登录与初始化\n在你的机器重启之后，你便可以第一次体验 i3 了。在 GNOME Display Manager （GDM），选择你的用户名，之后先别着急输密码，点击下方的密码输入框下方的小齿轮，之后选择 i3 ，像下方这样：\n\n输入你的密码，并点击 Sign In。在你第一次登入之后，会先看到 i3 的配置界面：\n\n点击 ENTER 就会在 $HOME/.config/i3 生成一个配置文件，之后你可以通过这个配置文件来定制化 i3's 的一些行为。\n在下一屏，你需要选择你的 Mod 键。这一步很关键，因为 Mod 键通常都会作为 i3's 命令快捷键的发起键。按 ENTER 会选择 Win 键作为默认的 Mod 键。如果你的键盘没有 Win 键，用 Alt 键做替代，用方向键键选择后按 ENTER 确认。\n\n现在你就登录到了 i3 的系统中。由于 i3 是一个最小化的窗口管理器，你会看到一个黑屏窗口，以及屏幕底端显式的状态栏：\n\n接下来，让我们看看 i3 的如何实际使用。\n\n3. 基本的快捷键\n现在你已经登录到了 i3 的会话中，你需要几个基本的快捷键来应对基本的操作。\n大多数的 i3 快捷键都会用到之前配置的 Mod 键。在下面的例子中，当我提到 Mod 键，请根据情况使用你定义的做替换。通常使用 Win 键或者 Alt 键。\n首先，打开一个终端，使用 Mod+ENTER。重复打开几个终端，观察 i3 是如何自动将它们在桌面中排列。默认情况下， i3 会在水平的方向分割屏幕；使用 Mod + v 来垂直分割，再按 Mod + h 会恢复水平分割模式。\n\n当需要启动其他的应用，按 Mod + d 来打开 dmenu，一个简单的文字应用菜单。默认情况下，dmenu 会呈现出所有在你 $PATH 中设置的应用。使用方向键来选择你想启动的应用，同时你可以键入应用的名称，来缩小选择的范围，之后按 ENTER 来启动选择的应用。\n\n如果你的应用没有提供退出的方法，你可以使用 i3 来关闭对应的窗口，通过按 Mod + Shift +q。注意，你可能会丢失未保存的工作内容。\n最后，当你想关闭会话并退出 i3，按 Mod + Shift +e。之后会在窗口的上方提示你是否退出。点击 Yes, exit i3 退出，或选择 X 来取消。\n\n这些就是 i3 中最基本的快捷键，如果想了解更多，请查阅官方文档 documentation。\n\n4. 替换GDM\n使用 i3 window manager 会降低你操作系统的内存占用；然而，Fedora 依然会使用 GDM 作为登录的窗口。GDM 会载入几个与 GNOME 相关的库从而占用内存。\n如果你想进一步的降低你的内存占用，你可以使用一些更轻量级的窗口管理器来替换 GDM，比如 lightdm：\n\n之后重启你的机器来使用 Lightdm 的登录界面。\n现在你可以继续登录并使用 i3了。\n\n\nvia:

贝叶斯估计之间的关系\n其中，最大似然估计（MLE）是频率派的代表，贝叶斯估计（Bayes）是贝叶斯派的代表，最大后验估计是频率派和贝叶斯派的合成，是一种规则化后的最大似然估计。\n一般来说，在我们对于先验概率一无所知时，只能假设每种猜测的先验概率是均等的（其实这也是人类经验的结果），这个时候就只有用最大似然了，但不能忘记一个重要的前提是所有的采样都是独立同分布。\n如果我们有足够的自信，训练集中的样本分布的确很接近真实的情况，这时就应该用贝叶斯方法。贝叶斯学派强调的是“靠谱的先验概率”。所以说贝叶斯学派的适用范围更广，关键要先验概率靠谱，而频率学派有效的前提也是他们的先验概率同样是经验统计的结果。但也说明了贝叶斯计算要更为复杂，因为需要选择一个常用分布，并确定一个初始参数集作为先验分布。\n再者，MAP与MLE最大区别是MAP中加入了模型参数本身的概率分布，即是否考虑了先验知识。或者说。MLE中认为模型参数本身的概率的是均匀的，即该概率为一个固定值。\n\n参考\n统计自然语言处理（第2版）\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n","description":"","id":"https://blog.littleji.com/blog/20181022probabilisticgraphicalmodels1/","path":"/blog/20181022probabilisticgraphicalmodels1/","title":"概率图模型之一(ProbabilisticGraphicalModel-PGM)"},"https://blog.littleji.com/blog/20181025logstashgrokoverview/":{"body":"\n背景\nGrok

模型的种类主要集中在有监督学习.\n通过概率图,我们自然会联想到对应的概率问题,而每当概率问题出现,无可避免的会有频率学派与贝叶斯派的竞争,两派为了解决同一个问题开发出了不同的概率图模型,自然在这些概率图的模型分类中也出现了对应分支,分别为判别式与生成式.\n两个模型本身是解释同一种问题的不同角度,笔者最近对于该两个模型之间的对比与解释进行了学习,整理如下:\n\n二个模型在分类问题上的处理方式\n判别模型不关心数据是如何生成的，它只是对给定数据进行分类。\n因此，判别算法试图直接从数据中学习P（y | x），然后尝试对数据进行分类。\n另一方面，生成模型试图学习p（x，y），后来根据条件概率公式，可以将其转换为p（y | x）来对数据进行分类。\n\n为了便于理解这里举两个例子\n\n第一个例子\n当我们需要判断两种不同的语言(比如中文和英文)的时候:\n\n生成式模型:先去学习这两种不同的语言,再根据语言的输入去判断语言的种类\n判断式模型:直接根据输入判断到底属于哪种语言\n\n\n第二个例子\n假设有\n\n以及\n\n以及对应的几个数据:\n\n那么根据定义就可以求出联合概率分布为\np(x,y)y=0y=1\nx=11/20\nx=21/41/4\n\n对应的条件分布概率则为\np(y|x)y=0y=1\nx=110\nx=21/21/2\n\n\n一张图理解生成模型与判别模型的关系\n\n学习的目标是正确的将未知的数据进行分类,从图中我们可以很容易的看出:\n\n判别模型学习得到的是那条分类的曲线,其关注点在于分类的边界学习\n生成模型则学习得到的则是两类数据的具体分布情况\n\n\n生成模型与判别模型的优缺点\n\n生成模型的优点\n\n在不平衡的数据样本上,表现依然优异\n可输出所有类别下的估算概率\n更好的模型解释性\n更像是通用型

什么是有监督与无监督学习？\n对于机器学习的过程中，对于所要学习的数据，如果其为标注的数据则称为有监督学习，否则称为无监督学习。\n\n1.3 什么是泛化能力？\n泛化能力指一个经过学习后的模型，能够适应与处理新样本的能力，这也是机器学习的主要目标。\n\n1.4 什么是过拟合与欠拟合？\n\n过拟合：过拟合指在学习的过程中，模型把样本本身的特点而非目标模型的特点进行了学习，导致整体性能下降的情况。\n欠拟合：欠拟合则是对目标模型的一般性质还没有习得，主要是由于模型本身的学习与表达能力不够。\n\n\n1.5 过拟合与欠拟合如何解决？\n\n欠拟合的解决：通过增加模型的学习能力，如：增加学习轮数、增加神经网络的复杂度以提升其表现能力等。\n过拟合的解决：过拟合一般来说是只可缓解无法彻底解决，通过对学习使用的模型进行改进，如 ：减少相应的模型参数、降低神经网络复杂度等。\n\n\n1.6 什么是方差Variance和偏差Bias？\n方差与偏差是解释学习算法泛化性能的一种重要的工具，下面我们来说明二者的侧重点。\n首先,我们将所得到的训练数据等分成A,B,C3份,再借由这3份训练数据分别得出3个训练模型,那么\"方差\"指的是向这3个模型输入同样的测试样本,得出的输出结果的方差,借此来判断我们选择的模型对于不同的学习样本展现出的\"模型本身训练的稳定性\".\n其次,如果我们将上面的所有训练数据进行训练,并输入同样的测试样本,得到对应的输出结果X,将输出结果与真实的结果T进行比较,得到的差值就为偏差, 偏差则侧重于\"模型本身预测的精准度\"的衡量.\n方差,偏差,噪声三者共同主导了学习模型的误差,在学习初期由于模型的拟合能力不强,这个时候主要是由偏差主导了误差,当学习后期模型的拟合能力增强后,微小的数据扰动都会被模型所捕捉到,此时由方差来主导模型的误差.\n\n1.7 交叉验证\n为了能够具体的衡量模型的性能,交叉验证提供了这样一种性能评测的手段.\n交叉验证的思想是重复的利用数据,把数据进行切分为训练数据集与测试数据集,并在这个基础上进行反复的训练与测试,选取具有较好性能指标的模型.\n具体的思想是,在数据集上划分k个大小相同且互斥的子集,使用k-1个子集进行训练,最后一个进行测试,得出结果后,再选择不同的k-1个自己训练,最后一个进行测试,容易看出上面可最终得到k个模型,通过求取其平均误差得到该模型的测试误差.\n其中典型的k值为10.\n\n2 线性模型\n\n2.1 线性回归的原理\n\n线性模型:即通过将给定的一些特征进行线性组合所得到的模型.\n线性回归:通过学习得到一个线性的模型能够尽可能准确的预测输入数据的真实标记.\n线性回归的原理:使用了均方误差最小化的方法也就是常说的最小二乘法,即试图找到这么一条直线,使样本到直线上的欧氏距离之和最小.\n\n\n2.2 线性回归损失函数、代价函数、目标函数\n\n\n损失函数指的是单一训练集上产生的误差.\n\n\n代价函数则值得是模型在整个训练集上产生的平均误差.\n\n\n设学习后的模型f,面对测试样本X,模型对应的模拟输出f(X)以及X实际的输出Y,拟合的程度.有如下的表示方式\n$$\nL(Y, f(X))=(Y-f(X))^2\n$$\n\n\n但是仅仅通过损失函数来就纠正拟合误差并非我们的目标,我们的是目标是是让模型精确地同时,又尽量的减少模型的复杂度,于是就引入了正则化函数来衡量模型的复杂度,最终我们的目标函数是最小化误差与最小化模型复杂度之和也就是\n$$\n\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}L(y_i,f(x_i))+\\lambda J(f)\n$$\n前者是最小化经验风险,后者则是最小化结构风险\n\n\n\n3 线性模型的优化方法\n当我们得到了对应目标函数后,那么就需要具体的对该模型各个参数求最优解,也就是常见的最优化问题,这里有以下这么几个主要的算法.\n\n3.1 梯度下降法\n梯度下降法的优化思想是用当前位置负梯度方向作为搜索方向，因为该方向为当前位置的最快下降方向.\n\n3.2 随机梯度下降法\n由于梯度下降法使用了固定步长的,这样带来了后期收敛慢,其进入极小点的情况,这里通过选用随机梯度的下降,更容易突破局部极小点,从而收敛至全局极值点,不过也有迭代次数增加等缺点.\n\n3.3 牛顿法\n牛顿法不同于梯度向量,而是使用了二阶海森矩阵的逆矩阵来求解,相对来说比普通的梯度下降算法收敛速度更快,但是其要求必须具有二阶海森矩阵的逆矩阵条件,其计算非常复杂,该条件在大规模数据下往往无法保证.\n\n3.4 拟牛顿法\n拟牛顿法则是通过找到一个与海森矩阵类似性质的矩阵来替代,从而让计算更为容易.\n其中DFP BFGS L-BFGS都是比较重要的拟牛顿方法.\n\n3.5 其他自适应学习方法\nadagrad,adadelta,rmsprop,adam等一系列adaptive learning rate方法\n\n4 线性回归的评估指标\n\n4.1查准率 全查率与F1\n二分类问题有四种预测的情况:\n真正例:true positive\n假正例:false positive\n真反例:true negative\n假反例:false negative\n查准率P与全查率R为\n$$\nP=\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\n$$\n$$\nR=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}\n$$\n二者一般矛盾,因为查全率高意味着查的个数多,这样又会导致查准率下降\n由查全率作为横轴,查准率作为纵轴形成P-R曲线,比较学习期的的性能时,比较该曲线的面积是一个方法\n平衡点(Break-Event Point)是查准率等于查全率的取值,这样可以权衡查全率和查准率\nBEP还是有些简化,更常用的是F1度量,目的是为了找出更好的学习器\nF1:基于查准率和查全率的调和平均值(harmonic mean):\n$$\nF1=\\frac{2PR}{P+R}=\\frac{2TP}{样例总数+TP-TN}\n$$\n$$\nF_\\beta=\\frac{(1+\\beta^{2})PR}{\\beta^2P +R}\n$$\n其中β&gt;0, β=1时就退化为标准的F1,β&lt;1时则查准更重要,β&gt;1则查全更重要\n很多时候我们有多个二分类混淆矩阵,例如进行多次训练和测试,每次都有一个,或者执行多分类任务,每每两个组合都对应一个混淆矩阵\n一种直接的做法是在所有的混淆矩阵都计算,然后计算所有的平均值也就是宏查重率macro-P和macro-R以及对应的macro F1\n\n4.2 ROC与AUC\n学习预测就是将样本进行排序,最可能是正例的排在前面\n神经网络一般情形下对每个测试样本预测出一个0-1的实值,然后将这个值作为截断点,大于这个截断点的样本为正例,其他的为反例,如果更重视查准率则可选择排序中靠前的位置,重视查全率则选择较后的截断点\n排序本身的质量好环则是体现了学习器在不同任务下的期望泛化性能,ROC曲线就是从这个角度来研究学习器泛化性能\nROC(Receiver Operating Characteristic)的操作方式与之前的P-R图类似,并提出了两个概念,真正利率TPR,假正利率FPR\n$$\nTPR=TP/(TP+FN)\n$$\n$$\nFPR=FP/(FP+TN)\n$$\n\n4.3 ROC绘制过程\n设正例数目为m+ 反例数目为m-\n\n均是先对所有的样例根据学习器的结果进行排序,然后将分类的阀值设置为最大,这时候均是反例,TPR=FPR=0\n2.调整阀值为依次每个样例的值,然后观察次样本是否为真正例,如果是坐标为(x,y+1/m+),如果不是坐标为(x+1/m-,y)\n比较ROC曲线的面积也就是AUC\n\nAUC更考虑的是样本预测的排序质量\n\n5

R$,其概率分布为$p(x)=P(X=x),x\\in \\mathbb R$,那么X的熵$H(X)$定义为:\n$$\nH(X)=-\\sum_{x \\in R}p(x)log_2p(x)\n$$\n\n联合熵\n联合熵其实就是描述一对随机变量平均所需要的信息量.\n如果$X,Y$是一对离散型随机变量 $X,Y ~ p(x,y),X,Y$的联合熵为$H(X,Y)$为:\n$$\nH(X,Y)=-\\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y}p(x,y)logp(x,y)\n$$\n\n条件熵\n条件熵$H(Y|X)$的意思是,在X发生的条件下,Y的不确定性有\n$$\nH(Y|X)=\\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y}p(x, y)logp(y | x)\n$$\n将联合概率进行展开后发现:\n$$\nH(X, Y)=-\\sum_{x \\in X}p(x)logp(x)-\\sum_{x \\in X}\\sum_{y \\in Y}p(x, y)logp(y | x) = H(X)+H(Y|X)\n$$\n\n信息增益\n现在有属性a, 其可能有v个可能的取值,如果使用属性a来对样本D进行划分的话,易知会产生v个节点,那么所有属性为$a_v$的样本可记为$D^v$.,这时候再根据各个节点对应所占的比例$|D^v|/|D|$分配权重,就可以知道使用属性a对D进行划分的时候所获得的信息增益,也就是说使用整个样本的信息熵,减去通过属性a划分的信息熵之和就是信息增益.\n现在假设样本D的信息熵为\n$$\nEnt(D)=-\\sum_{k=1}^{|v|}p_klog_2p_k\n$$\n那么信息增益为:\n$$\nGain(D,a)=Ent(D)-\\sum_{v=1}^{V}\\frac{|D^v|}{|D|}Ent(D^v)\n$$\n\n基尼不纯度\n基尼不纯度是CART算法划分属性所使用的度量方法,其直观上的理解是从一个数据集D中任意抽取两个样本,其类别不一致的概率.其具体的公式如下:\n$$\nGini(D)=\\sum_{k=1}{|y|}\\sum_{k^{'}\\neq k}(p_kp_k')\n$$\n\n决策树的不同分类算法\n\nID3算法\n流程具体如下:\n\n首先考虑样本中只有一个类或者没有属性的情况\n计算各个属性的信息增益后\n选择信息增益最多的属性进行节点分类,建立各个节点分支\n再依次的再各个节点中进行选择计算信息增益,返回步骤2重复迭代\n到达指定的退出条件,没有特征或者信息增益较小\n由于ID3 算法只有生成树的过程,没有剪枝等过程,所以可能过拟合.\n\n\nC4.5\n首先,信息增益比的定义是信息增益G(D,a)与训练数据集熵H(D)的比\n$$\ng_R(D,a)=\\frac{g(D,a)}{H(D)}\n$$\n该C4.5算法则是针对于ID3算法的改进,在生成树的过程中使用了信息增益比来选择,而不是单纯的使用信息增益\n算法过程如下:\n假设 数据集D 特征集A 阀值ε\n\n如果数据中均为同一个类,则返回,算法结束\n如果 $A=\\varnothing$, 则返回一个单节点的树,并选择实例数最多的类,为该节点的类别,算法结束\n选择其中信息增益比最大的节点\n再依次选择各个节点,计算当前节点的内的信息增益比,进行迭代\n最终达到指定的退出条件,即信息增益比过低,或者没有更多的特征时退出算法\n\n上面的构建的节点树都是分类树,只不过节点划分的方式不同.那么什么是回归树呢?\n\n回归树原理\n回归树对于样本的划分,通过遍历所有输入变量，找到最优的切分变量j和最优的切分点s，即选择第j个特征$x^j$和它的取值s将输入空间划分为两部分，然后重复这个操作,对于连续性的样本值非常有效.\n具体算法如下\n\n选择最优的切分变量j和最优的切分点s，求解\n$$\nmin_{j,s}[min_{c_{1}}\\sum_{x_{i}\\in R_{1}(j,s)}(y_{i}-c_{1})^2+min_{c_{2}}\\sum_{x_{i}\\in R_{2}(j,s)}(y_{i}-c_{2})^2]\n$$\n遍历所有特征，对固定的特征扫描所有取值，找到使上式达到最小值的对(j,s).\n用选定的对 (j,s)划分区域，并确定该区域的预测值；\n继续对两个字区域调用上述步骤，直至满足停止条件；\n\n\nCART分类树\nCART分类树的全称是分类与回归树,主要的原理思想是将内部的节点特征取值为\"是\"或\"否\"两个值,左分支为是,右分支为否,这样整个决策树就可以在整个样本空间中求取对应的条件概率分布.\n算法由特征选择和生成树以及前面两种算法所没有的剪枝构成,算法主要包括两个部分:树的生成与剪枝\n\nCART的生成\n从根节点开始，对节点计算现有特征的基尼指数，对每一个特征，例如AA，再对其每个可能的取值如aa,根据样本点对A=aA=a的结果的”是“与”否“划分为两个部分，利用\n$$\nGini(D,A=a)=\\frac{|D_{1}|}{|D|}Gini(D_{1})+\\frac{|D_{2}|}{|D|}Gini(D_{2})\n$$\n进行计算；在所有可能的特征AA以及该特征所有的可能取值a中，选择基尼指数最小的特征及其对应的取值作为最优特征和最优切分点。然后根据最优特征和最优切分点，将本节点的数据集二分，生成两个子节点\n对两个字节点递归地调用上述步骤，直至节点中的样本个数小于阈值，或者样本集的基尼指数小于阈值，或者没有更多特征后停止；\n\nCART的剪枝\n剪枝就是对生成的树进行裁剪简化的过程,其一般是通过极小化决策树整体的损失函数或代价函数来实现.\nCART的剪枝是通过两个步骤:\n\n从树的底部不断地剪枝直到根节点,形成对应的子树序列\n通过交叉验证法,对子树的序列进行测试,并从中选取最优的子树\n\n\n决策树防止过拟合手段\n决策树过拟合主要有两个手段,分别为early stopping与剪枝.\n\nearlystopping:限制选取的分类节点的总数,树的深度,节点中的实例数,阈值等\n剪枝,即当前节点的划分无法带来决策树泛化性能的提升,增删除对应的节点\n\n\n模型评估\n可以使用之前梳理的AUC ROC 交叉验证 随机抽样等方法,这里就不再赘述了.\n\npython可视化决策树与对应的函数实现\n\n主要的函数为\n\n参考\n统计自然语言处理-宗成庆\n机器学习-周志华\n统计学习方法-李航\n决策树(分类树、回归树\nDecision tree visual
